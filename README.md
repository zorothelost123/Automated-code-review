# Automated-code-review
Worked on an Automated Code Review project, using Python for code analysis and error detection, with Java, JSON, and CSS for system integration and user interface development, to streamline code quality checks and feedback.

# 🔍 Automated Code Review System

This Python-based tool performs **automated static code analysis** for various programming languages including Python, JavaScript, HTML, Java, C, and C++. It helps identify code complexity, style violations, security issues, duplicate lines, runtime errors, and suggests fixes — all in one go!
